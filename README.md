# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers into different groups based on their annual income and spending score. The goal is to provide actionable insights for businesses to target specific customer segments more effectively, improving marketing strategies and customer retention.

### **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and selecting relevant attributes.
- **Clustering**: Using the K-Means algorithm to create customer segments.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying PCA for visualizing high-dimensional data.
- **Visualizations**: Plotting customer clusters for better understanding of the segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographic and spending behavior data, including features like:
- **Annual Income (k$)**
- **Spending Score (1-100)**

You can download the dataset from Kaggle or use any customer behavior dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
